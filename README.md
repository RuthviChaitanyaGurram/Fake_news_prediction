# Fake_news_prediction
Overview
This project aims to detect fake news using machine learning techniques. With the proliferation of misinformation on social media and other platforms, identifying fake news articles has become increasingly important to promote information integrity and combat the spread of false information.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Fake News Prediction Dataset, which features both real and fake news articles. It includes columns such as 'Title', 'Text', and 'Label' (Fake or Real), providing a basis for predictive modeling to identify misinformation.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing: The textual data is preprocessed by combining the 'Title' and 'Text' columns, tokenizing the text, and padding sequences to ensure uniform length for model input.

Modeling: Three different models are implemented for comparison:

Deep Learning Model using TensorFlow/Keras
Logistic Regression Model
Random Forest Classifier
Evaluation: The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The deep learning model achieved the highest accuracy, followed by the random forest classifier and logistic regression model.

Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-detection.git
cd fake-news-detection
Install the required libraries:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the models.

Conclusion
This project contributes to the efforts in combating misinformation and promoting media literacy by providing a practical approach to detect fake news articles using machine learning techniques. By leveraging the Fake News Prediction Dataset and implementing various models, it aims to enhance information integrity and raise awareness about the prevalence of false information in news media.
